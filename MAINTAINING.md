# QC-Devs Maintainer Guide

## Introduction

This document discusses our default repository setup.
It can be used as a set of step-by-step instructions for starting a new repository
or upgrading an existing one.
The goal is to achieve more consistency across all [QC-Devs](https://qcdevs.org/) projects,
and to provide tools to make your repository welcoming to contributions
in a way that is consistent with our
[Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This guide is a modular collection of mini-tutorials
for setting up your repository and learning best practices.
As with all of our work, contributions to this document are welcome.
